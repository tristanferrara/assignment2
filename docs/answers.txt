a. On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
        docs/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present

b. Eight commits (command: git log)

c. .gitignore was last modified at 6:13PM on Sept. 25, 2019 (command: git log --follow .gitignore)

d.	1. To allow work to get done without modifying the original code
	2. To allow people to work on code simultaneously
	
e. git log shows all past commits; git status shows files that have been changed and need to be committed

f. git log --follow Vehicle.h 

g. git log --all --grep='Build 0051'

h.	1. Inheritance: Where a subclass retains certain properties of its superclass.
	2. Polymorphism: Where a child class object can take the form of any other object above it in its hierarchy.
	3. Encapsulation: The bundling of data with methods that work on that data, such as a class.
	
i.	In the "Integration manager" workflow, developers are their own "Lieutenants", in the sense that
they must resolve their own coflicts.

j. The "Dictators and Lieutenants" workflow would be more beneficial for 100 developers because
it would ensure that specific people can work on resolving conflicts while others are working on
the source code.

Polymorphism: Yes, the Driving simulator uses polymorphism, as each subclass of Vehicle is used as Vehicle in main.cpp
in order to print from the Vehicle array.

Encapsulation: Yes, the Driving simulator uses encapsulation, as in each subclass of Vehicle, the calculation for mileage
is encapsulated in the class.
